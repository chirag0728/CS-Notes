## Welcome to my Github!

I'm using this website to put my notes from my paintrain of books which consist of programming languages, cybersecurity and java certifications, and different courses that I take through my journey as a Computer Science student at Arizona State University. 

I hope that through this website, it can help multiple people through the information and the exercise answers from the different books that I work on as well as the different amount of code. 

### List of Books:

```ruby
- OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff
- Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
- Introduction to Computer Security (part of CSE365: Introduction to Cyber Assurance)
- Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers, 6th Edition by Douglas C. Montgomery (part of IEE380: Applied Statistics)

Disclaimer: these are simply notes and exercises that I have had from my self study endeavors and my classes.

These will keep getting updated.
